The Laravel-based Product Management System implementation is complete. This includes:

Migration: Creates the products table with the required schema.
Model: Defines the Product model.
Controller: Handles CRUD operations and integrates Eloquent ORM.
Routes: Sets up RESTful routes using Route::resource.
Views: Implement the corresponding Blade templates:
index.blade.php for listing products with pagination, sorting, and search.
create.blade.php for adding a new product.
edit.blade.php for editing an existing product.
show.blade.php for viewing product details.
Let me know if you need help with the Blade templates or additional features!
